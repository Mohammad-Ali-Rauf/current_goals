# ðŸŽ¯ MY CYBER OPERATIONS JOURNEY

## ðŸ§  MY MINDSET: "I Build to Understand, I Break to Learn"
*I follow my curiosity, not someone else's timeline*

## ðŸŸ¢ WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW
- **Mastering Linux & Bash** - I'm moving from just using Linux to understanding its soul
- **Networking Deep Dive** - I'm seeing protocols not as abstractions, but as attack surfaces
- **My Active Dev Projects** - Every line of code I write, I'm also learning how to break it

## ðŸ”µ MY NEXT NATURAL STEPS
- **Web App Pentesting** - This feels like the obvious extension of my developer brain
- **Windows Internals** - I need to understand the corporate world's operating system
- **Mythic C2 Play** - Where my coding skills meet actual tradecraft - this excites me

## ðŸŸ£ WHERE I SEE MYSELF GOING
- **Reverse Engineering** - The ultimate puzzle that completes my understanding
- **Cloud Native Security - Docker and K8s** - Because everything's moving there anyway
- **Building My Own Tools** - Using Go to create what doesn't exist yet

## ðŸ’ª MY SUPERPOWERS
- **Next.js** - I understand modern web architecture from the inside
- **TypeScript** - Code is my native language, and this is my dialect
- **Databases** - MongoDB taught me how applications really store things
